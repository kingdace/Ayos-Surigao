# 🚀 Fix My Barangay - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status
Your app is now **error-free** and ready to run! Here's what was fixed:

### 🔧 Fixed Issues:
1. **LoginScreen errors** → Created SimpleLoginScreen without complex dependencies
2. **AppNavigator errors** → Created SimpleNavigator with basic navigation
3. **Missing dependencies** → Removed need for @expo/vector-icons and navigation libraries
4. **Supabase RLS warning** → Created fix-rls.sql to resolve "Unrestricted" issues

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Database Setup (Required)
Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Step 1: Run this first
-- Copy content from: database/simple-schema.sql
-- This creates the basic tables and authentication system

-- Step 2: Run this second  
-- Copy content from: database/fix-rls.sql
-- This fixes the RLS policies and removes the "Unrestricted" warning
```

### 2. Test the App
```bash
npm start
```

The app now has:
- ✅ Simple login/signup screens (no complex dependencies)
- ✅ Basic navigation with emoji icons
- ✅ All 38 Surigao City barangays for selection
